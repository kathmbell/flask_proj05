# A few comments
- dont keep code thats commented in your repo; generally poor form because its distracting to another developer trying to understand what your code does.
- maybe add some screenshots

- Look into jinja2 inheritance for your templates files.  https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-ii-templates


# linting
Its making sure your code is properly formatted.  using "black" is pretty common now:

```bash
pip install black
black flask_proj05/
```
